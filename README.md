Simply put, Hypertext Pre Processor, commonly known as PHP (http://www.php.net) is a scripting language that is widely used, though not limited to, the World Wide Web (WWW). PHP may also be used be used as a general programming language, but it is being primarly used as a server side language to power many websites on the Internet

Getting Started
---------------

As part of the requirements for writing PHP code for these lessons, the following will be required: 

	* Web Server 
	* PHP 
	* Database Server (e.g [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com), MariaDB, PostGreSQL)

For our purposes, we will be using a prepacked stack that ships with Apache (Web Server), PHP & MySQL. For easy initial setup, I would reccomend any of the following: 

	(Windows Users) - [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) - [Download Here](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) - [Setup Instructions](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
	(Linux Users) -   LAMP (Please see respective instructions based on distro. Also consider XAMPP)
	(Macintosh Users) - [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) - [Download Here](http://www.mamp.info/downloads/releases/MAMP_PRO.zip) - [Setup Instructions](http://documentation.mamp.info/en)

Also recommended is [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)

Ready to Rocket 
------------------

Once you have successfully installed your webserver and it is up and running, it is now time to get our first PHP Script(s) written.
