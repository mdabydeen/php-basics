---------------

Simply put, Hypertext Pre Processor, commonly known as PHP (http://www.php.net) is a scripting language that is widely used, though not limited to, the World Wide Web (WWW). PHP may also be used be used as a general programming language, but it is being primarly used as a server side language to power many websites on the Internet

There are many reasons why people choose PHP as their preferred language, some of which includes: 

* Easy to setup and use. 
* Easy to learn and master
	* Very friendly to beginners, novices and even experts of other programming languages. 
* Has roots in languages like C, Perl, Python
* Very flexible and malliable
* Not as restrictive as many other programming languages.

Getting Started
---------------

As part of the requirements for writing PHP code for these lessons, the following will be required: 

* Web Server 
* PHP 
* Database Server (e.g [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [PostGreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/))

For our purposes, we will be using a prepacked stack that ships with Apache (Web Server), PHP & MySQL. For easy initial setup, I would reccomend any of the following: 

*Windows Users 
	* [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) 
		* [Download Here](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) 
		* [Setup Instructions](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)

*Linux Users
	* LAMP (Please see respective instructions based on distro)
	* Also consider [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)

*Macintosh Users
	* [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html)
		* [Download Here](http://www.mamp.info/downloads/releases/MAMP_PRO.zip)
		* [Setup Instructions](http://documentation.mamp.info/en)

* Also recommended is [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)

Ready to Rocket 
------------------

Once you have successfully installed your webserver and it is up and running, it is now time to get our first PHP Script(s) written.
